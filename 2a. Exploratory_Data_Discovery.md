# Preliminary Data Discovery & Analytical Insights from Olist Datasets

Using seven datasets...
- olist_customers_dataset.csv  
- olist_orders_dataset.csv  
- olist_order_items_dataset.csv  
- olist_order_payments_dataset.csv  
- olist_products_dataset.csv  
- olist_sellers_dataset.csv  
- olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv  

... we can perform several critical analytical tasks by joining them together. These combined insights are far more valuable than analyzing datasets individually and can lead to actionable business decisions.
